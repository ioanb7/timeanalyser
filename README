Steps to use this:
* python bot/app.py is executed, and !archive is called from the discord server you want to archive. a file rawdata.txt is produced
* rawdata.txt goes in HDFS under /user/{$USER}
* time analyser is executed on the input rawdata.txt
* a file part-00000 is produced, renamed under database.txt and moved under bot/ again
* the command !reload is called on any server on the discord
* any user can run "!activity" or "!activity @username" and it comes up with a message "Replying every X minutes. Not bad."

NOTE: the commands !archive and !reload only work for one user_id. make sure you modify that.
